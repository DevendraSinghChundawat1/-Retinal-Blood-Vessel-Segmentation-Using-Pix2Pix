Retinal Blood Vessel Segmentation Using Pix2Pix

 In this project we discuss Pix2Pix GAN structure to implement the neural network for segmenting blood vessels in retinal images. For exemplification, we trained and tested the GAN model using retinal images from three public databases: CHASE and DRIVE. Training and testing of Pix2Pix GAN were performed in Python 3.8.8.
